        "1.   This paper is about a methodical way to clean data. The author points out how there is a lot of research into data anyalsis, but little into data cleaning. Thus, this paper covers what he calls \"tidy data.\"\n",
        "2.   The tidy data standard is created to give a baseline standard for what a clean data set looks like. Often, more data cleaning might be needed to support different anaylisis or added data. However, the tidy data standard is met to be a common standard starting point for dataset cleaning.\n",
        "3.  The first sentence presented in the question means that a clean or tidy dataset is alike to all other tidy datasets, because they follow the same standards. However, a messy dataset is its unique kind of messy. All untidy datasets do not have the same standards so the path to making them tidy is going to be diffeernt for everyone. The second sentence means that variables and observations are very easy to identidy, but hard to define. Observations and variables also depend on the data's context. Variables are for an \"underlaying attribute\" and observations are for measured values across attributes.\n",
        "4.  Values are numerical or textual inputs. Each value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable is a measurable catagory or attibute like height. An observation is what or who that value belongs to like a person.\n",
        "5.  Tidy data is when an every variable creates a column and each observation creates a row. A table is made up of only one observational unit.\n",
        "6.  The 5 most common problems with messy data are column headers with values, multiple variables in one column, variables stored in columns and rows, more than one observational unit stored in one table, and one observational unit stored across many tables. The table in table 4 are messy because there are values in the column header. It should instead be religon, income,and frequency as the columns or variables. Melting the dataset means to pivot it longer or to stack the data. In practice, this means to turn columns into rows.\n",
        "7.  Table 11 is messy because the day should be a varaible with the date as a value. All of the d1,d2,etc should be values for the day varaible. Addionally, tmin and tmax are variables so they should be columns,Table 12 is molten because now date is one column. Then, the second table is tidy because tmin and tmax each have thier own column as seperate varaibles.\n",
        "8.  The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with tidy data is that tidy data is only as useful as the tools built around it. Tidy tools are only as useful as the tidy data. This makes breaking out of this box hard for future explanion. As such, Wickham wants to see more frameworks developed for data cleaning. He does not suggest tidy data is the best solution; instead, he hopes to shed light on a part of data science that needs more attention.\n"
